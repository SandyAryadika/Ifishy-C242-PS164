# [Ifishy API Endpoints Documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AnR8ifyktgZRyspRoGS_CgjIDOoaJQElb6PeBWj_5q8/edit?gid=1400970446#gid=1400970446)
The `/predict` endpoint is designed to handle fish disease detection. Users can upload an image file, and the API processes the image to provide a prediction result, identifying the disease and its confidence level. This endpoint serves as the core of the applicationâ€™s fish health analysis feature, leveraging machine learning for accurate predictions.

# Technology Stack
IFISHY uses a modern and scalable technology stack for its development and deployment:

### Backend
- FastAPI: A high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, utilizing standard Python type hints.
- Uvicorn: An ASGI server for Python, providing fast performance for serving FastAPI applications.
- TensorFlow: Open-source machine learning library for building and deploying machine learning models for fish disease detection.
- Pillow: Image processing library to handle image manipulation and format conversion.
- NumPy: A powerful library for numerical computing in Python, used for handling large, multi-dimensional arrays.
- python-multipart: A library to handle file uploads via multipart/form-data encoding.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Cloud Run: Fully managed compute platform to deploy containerized applications, including backend APIs and prediction models.
- Cloud Storage: Storage service to handle user-uploaded files, such as images and documents.
- Artifact Registry: Service for storing and managing Docker images in Google Cloud.

# Deployment to Cloud Run via Docker and Artifact Registry
Here are the steps to deploy the IFISHY application to Google Cloud Run using Docker and Artifact Registry.

### Step 1: Prepare the Environment
1. Install Dependencies
   Run the following command to install all required libraries from requirements.txt:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 2: Create a Docker Image
1. Dockerfile

   Create a Dockerfile in the root folder with the following configuration:
```
   FROM python:3.12-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt /app/
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   COPY . /app/
   EXPOSE 8080
   CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

2. Build the Docker Image

   Use Docker to build the image:
```
   docker build -t ifishy-api .
```

### Step 3: Push the Docker Image to Artifact Registry
1. Tag the Docker Image

   Tag the Docker image for Artifact Registry in Google Cloud:
```
   docker tag ifishy-api REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY/ifishy-api
```

2. Push the Docker Image

   Push the tagged image to Artifact Registry:
```
   docker push REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY/ifishy-api
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Image to Cloud Run
1. Deploy the Container

   Use the following command to deploy the Docker image to Cloud Run:
```
   gcloud run deploy ifishy-api --image REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY/ifishy-api --platform managed --region asia-southeast2 --allow-unauthenticated
```

2. After the deployment is complete, you will receive a Cloud Run URL which can be used to access the live application.

### Step 5: Monitor and Test
1. Monitor Logs
   Use Google Cloud Logging to monitor the logs and troubleshoot any errors.
