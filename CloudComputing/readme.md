Ifishy is an AI-powered mobile application designed to help freshwater fish farmers detect and manage fish diseases. The app uses a camera-based system to identify various diseases such as Aeromoniasis, Bacterial Gill Disease, and White Tail Disease through real-time image analysis. In addition to disease detection, the app offers treatment recommendations and preventive measures to support sustainable and productive fish farming. Our project integrates machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing to create a reliable, scalable solution for farmers.
